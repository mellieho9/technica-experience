# Projects I have been involved in Tech + Research

## Background
Every year, I would come down to the University of Maryland to participate in the university's workshop for prospective women in Computer Science research, Tech + Research. The workshops have enabled me to explore design thinking, project management, and AI, as well as find fellow women in tech. This repository contains links and demos of the projects I have done in the program so far.

## The projects

### Finnacle

With 6 researchers, I conducted UI/UX research on elders and designed a fintech application that enhances senior users' financial literacy through shared accountability, protection alerts, as well as simplified and dementia-friendly settings.

### Automated Assistant for Course Management

With 7 researchers, I explored original AI and utilized its technique to an algorithmic system that automatically allocates the time window and location of courses according to information about the course, location, and professor. With more time to flesh out the UI, we could implement and transform the course scheduling process at the University of Maryland, where professors have traditionally assigned courses manually using post-it notes and spreadsheets.
